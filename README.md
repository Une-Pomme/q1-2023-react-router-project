# React Router Project
This is the project built for the "Section 9: Navigation with React Router" section of Oak Academy's "Typescript & React JS Course with React & Typescript Project" Udemy course.

## What I got out of this project
- React Router's Link tag outputs an anchor tag in the browser, but prevents the default action from occurring when you click on the anchor tag (i.e, doesn't send the request to the server)
-- This makes loading smoother and quicker
- When you use a NavLink rather than an Link, you get an active class and an 'aria-current="page"' property
